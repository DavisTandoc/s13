ODM
	- Object Document Mapper
		- a tool that translates objects in code to document for use in document-based databases such as MongoDB
Mongoose
	- is an Object Document Mapper library for Node.JS and MongoDB.
	- it provides straightforward way to interact with MongoDB and define Schemas, models, and perform database operations using JavaScript.
Schema
	- is a representation of document's structure. It also contains document's expected properties and data types.

Models
	- a programming interface for querying or manipulating a database. A mongoose model contains methods that simplify such operations.

Separation of Concerns
	- better code readability
	- improved scalability
	- better code maintainability

	models
		- contains 'what' objects are needed in our API
			- courses
			- users
		-object schemas and relationships are defined here
			-- schemas are JSON objects that defined the structure and content of documents

		example:
			const courseSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
				name: {},
				description: {},
				price: {},
				isActive: {},
				createdOn: {},
				enrollees:[]
			})
		- controllers
			- contains instruction on HOW your API will perform its intended tasks
			- mongoose model queries are used here, examples:
				- Model.find()
				- Model.findById()
				- Model.findByIdAnd
		- routes
			- defines WHEN
